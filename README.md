## What is RIDE

Ride is an app created at Startup Weekend Detroit - Social Impact, to fix the broken transit system in Detroit. We are using Estimote beacons to track user data for residents using the bus system, and simplify the payment process inside the bus.

This will give us better estimates of arrival times for the bus, and allow residents to have a much more seamless experience riding the bus.
